-- * Artifact Creation
-- | Type class for builders producing artifacts as defined by the 'InitArgs'.
-- Builders have input, state and output, and are controlled by a build-life
-- cycle. An artifact may represent a real world artifact, like e.g. a file or
-- an OS process running on the host, which can only be created or modified
-- using effectfull computations.
--
-- An artifact can of course be a pure piece of data.
-- This makes sense in order to sequence the real world effects of other
-- artifacts. For example, to read contents from source files, then combine and
-- transform  that content in some way and write it to multiple output files,
-- there would be a pure artifact _in the middle_ gathereing the content from
-- the inputs, and, as soon as all inputs are provided, providing it to the
-- output files.
--
-- It is an explicit design goal to be able to interleave artifact generation,
-- such that modifications done to an artifact can be done depending on two
-- parameters, one could e.g. be passed in the free monad (BuildStep) and the
-- is attained only later when e.g. the actual contents have been built.
--
-- This is an example for usage of the types in a manner allowing this:
--
-- > do
-- >    outHandle <- initialiseBuilder (OutputFile "dest")
-- >    srcHandle <- initialiseBuilder (OutputFile "source")
-- >    docHandle <- initialiseBuilder (Document EmptyYamlObject)
-- >    applyToArtifact outHandle docHandle $
-- >      \doc -> execAction (WriteFile . renderYaml) doc
-- >    applyToArtifact docHandle srcHandle $
-- >      \out -> execAction (AppendDocument . parseYaml) out
--
-- This can be simplified with a helper function:
-- > modifyWithInput buildHandle modification inputHandle =
-- >   applyToArtifact buildHandle inputHandle $ execAction modification
--
-- So the above could be rewritten as:
-- > outHandle <- allocateHandle (initialiseBuilder (OutputFile "dest"))
-- > srcHandle <- allocateHandle (initialiseBuilder (OutputFile "source"))
-- > docHandle <- allocateHandle (initialiseBuilder (Document EmptyYamlObject))
-- > modifyWithInput outHandle docHandle (WriteFile . renderYaml)
-- > modifyWithInput docHandle srcHandle (AppendDocument . parseYaml)
--
-- The lexicographical order of modifications is now different from the
-- execution sequence, given appropriate (in any case 'possible')
-- implementations of allocateHandle and modifyWithInput.
--
-- Another point is reordering of build actions to enable parallel execution of
-- independent sub tasks.
--
-- The fact that I want this thing to be a monad for syntactic reasons, as well
-- as the need for re-ordering of the 'BuildStep' /AST/ as one might put it,
-- calls for the use of 'Free'.
--
-- The free monad is run by an interpreter that reorders all the build steps.
-- Since the 'BuildStep' is existential, typeclasses are used by the default
-- interpreter.
--
-- An artifact is build in a two step process:
--
-- > initialiseBuilder -> (modification ->)* buildArtifact -> (extraction ->)* GC
-- > \_________________  _________________/\________________  ________________/
-- >                   \/                                   \/
-- >              Build  Phase                      Extraction Phase
--
-- The artifact in the build phase is modified by appending/composing values
-- wrapped inside a functor. This functor could for example be a state
-- monad, a reader, a writer, or maybe just 'IdentityT'.
-- After the build phase was ended using 'buildArtifact' it is possible
-- to extract content out of the artifact.
--
-- After build-phase it is assumed that the artifact has consumed all
-- modifications and has assumed it's final state, where it is ready to be
-- used as input to other artifact builds. The output of an artifact build
-- is not necessarily effectful, it isn't required for an 'ArtifactOutput'
-- to be a functor/monad/applicative or even a monoid.
class (Typeable k,Typeable a,Typeable (Artifact a),Typeable (BuilderState a),Monoid (BuilderWriter a),Typeable (BuilderWriter a)) => CanBuild (a :: k)  where
  -- | Contruction parameters required to create the artifact.
  -- You may wonder why on earth do I need a data family, why not just
  -- use 'a' directly?
  -- That would force a to have kind '*' which rules out uninhabited types.
  -- The recipe for using this is to define a phantom data type and an
  -- 'InitArgs' instance constructor with the same identifier, e.g.:
  --
  -- >
  -- > data OutFile c
  -- > instance (Put c) => CanBuild (OutFile c) where
  -- >    data InitArgs (OutFile c) = OutFile FilePath
  -- >

  -- > outFile f = create (OutFile f)
